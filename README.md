# TodoistNet
Todoist API v6 implemented in C#.

In current state the following is working:
- Adding projects and items
- Updating projects and items
- Read-only sync for projects, items, labels and notes
- Optional hierarchy for projects (project trees)
- Linking between projects, items, notes and labels

You'll need to get your access token from Todoist website because login isn't implemented.
